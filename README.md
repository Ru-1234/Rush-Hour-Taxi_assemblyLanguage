The Rush Hour Game is a console-based puzzle game developed in x86 Assembly Language using the Irvine32 library. The game simulates the classic Rush Hour logic puzzle, where the player must strategically move vehicles within a grid to reach the passenger. The game utilizes low-level programming concepts such as register manipulation, memory addressing, loops, conditional jumps, and procedure-based modular design. User input is handled through keyboard interaction, and the game state is dynamically updated and rendered in the console.
